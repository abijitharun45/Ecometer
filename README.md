## Ecometer - Carbon Footprint Calculator

Welcome to Ecometer, a project spearheaded by GDSC 2024! Our mission is to empower individuals to make a positive impact on the environment by measuring and reducing their carbon footprint. Throughout the development process, we utilized tools like Google Assistant and Gemini to streamline our workflow and address any queries that arose.

Developers interested in contributing to Ecometer are invited to join us in our endeavor. To get started, we recommend downloading XAMPP for local development setup. Together, let's make a difference in the fight against climate change.

Join the movement. Measure, reduce, and track your carbon footprint with Ecometer.
